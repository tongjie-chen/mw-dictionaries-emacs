This is modified from https://github.com/agzam/mw-thesaurus.el. Learner dictionary is totally usable.

While collegiate is usable but have some wrinkles to iron.

Added a function to save the queried word to a vocabulary builder file you specify with variable ~mw-learner-builder-file~ or ~mw-collegiate-builder-file~.

* Usage
After add to load path and ~(require 'mw-learner)~ or ~(require 'mw-collegiate)~, you can look up words at point with ~mw-learner-lookup-at-point~ or ~mw-collegiate-lookup-at-point~. A function to search with argument is applied as ~mw-learner-lookup-string~ and ~mw-collegiate-lookup-string~.
